# Garden Station Project
Garden station is a web application that tracks data from my garden and displays it on a web page. It is designed using the LAMP stack framework.

The following data will be tracked:
- Moisture levels of the soil
- Temperature
- Wind speed and direction
- Air pressure

There should also be a live feed of the garden from the front.

Initially the web page should only be accessible to local traffic so the data can be accessed from home or devices connected via VPN. 

This document is intended to give you instructions on what you need to get this project running. For a more in depth look at the purpose, design, functionality and future improvements the wiki contains further information.
